Copied from http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/plugin.html,
this is just here to make it super clear how to layout your code for
twisted.plugin.

Make sure this directory is in PYTHONPATH.  Note that twisted and
twisted/plugins are NOT packages, but are specially trawled by getPlugins.
